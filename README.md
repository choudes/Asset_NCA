# Network Centrality Analysis Toolkit

This project provides a Python-based toolkit for identifying critical network assets by analyzing synthetic network log data. It leverages graph theory and centrality analysis to pinpoint the most important nodes (e.g., servers, clients) in a network based on their connectivity and traffic patterns.

The toolkit includes scripts to:
1.  Generate realistic, synthetic Netflow and Zeek logs.
2.  Construct a network graph from the log data.
3.  Calculate key centrality measures to rank network assets by importance.
4.  Create an interactive visualization of the network graph.

## Project Components

This repository contains three main Python scripts that can be used in two primary workflows.

* `data_generator.py`: A detailed data generation script that creates synthetic `netflow_log.csv` and `zeek_conn_log.csv` files. It simulates a network with a clear client-server topology, intentionally biasing traffic to make server assets more central.

* `centrality_analyzer.py`: An analysis script that loads the data generated by `data_generator.py`, builds a network graph, and performs an in-depth centrality analysis. It calculates Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, and Eigenvector centrality, printing the top-ranked assets for each measure to the console.

* `main.py`: A self-contained, end-to-end pipeline. This script performs its own data generation, analysis, and, most importantly, generates an interactive HTML visualization of the network graph using the `pyvis` library, allowing for visual exploration of the most critical nodes.

## Prerequisites

This project is written in Python 3. The following libraries are required to run the scripts:

* pandas
* numpy
* networkx
* faker
* pyvis

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy networkx faker pyvis
    ```

## Usage

You can use this toolkit in two ways, depending on your needs.

### Option 1: Detailed Data Generation & Console Analysis

This workflow is ideal for focusing on the data generation logic and viewing a detailed, text-based analysis.

1.  **Generate the detailed log files:**
    ```bash
    python data_generator.py
    ```
    This will create `netflow_log.csv` and `zeek_conn_log.csv` in your directory.

2.  **Run the centrality analyzer:**
    ```bash
    python centrality_analyzer.py
    ```
    This script will load the generated files, perform the analysis, and print the top 5 most critical assets for each centrality metric to your console.

### Option 2: All-in-One Pipeline with Interactive Visualization

This workflow uses the `main.py` script to handle everything from data generation to visualization in a single step.

1.  **Run the main pipeline:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Outputs

After running the scripts, you can expect the following outputs:

1.  **Console Output**: The scripts will print their progress and the final analysis results to the console. The analysis output will look similar to this:

    ```
    --- Top Critical Assets ---
   
    # Top 5 by Degree Centrality:
      1. 10.0.0.101      (Score: 0.9740)
      2. 10.0.0.103      (Score: 0.9740)
      ...
   
    # Top 5 by Betweenness Centrality:
      1. 10.0.0.102      (Score: 0.1336)
      2. 10.0.0.104      (Score: 0.1309)
      ...
    ```

2.  **Generated Data Files**:
    * `netflow_log.csv` & `zeek_conn_log.csv` (from `data_generator.py`)
    * `netflow.csv` & `zeek.csv` (from `main.py`)

3.  **Interactive Visualization**:
    * `network_graph.html`: An HTML file will be created by `main.py`. Open this file in your web browser to see an interactive force-directed graph of the most central network nodes. You can drag nodes, zoom in, and hover to see more details.
